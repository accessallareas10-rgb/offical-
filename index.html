  <h2>Why This Matters: A Snapshot of Urgent Need</h2>
  <img src="Picture 3.jpg" alt="student left out of circle" class="image" />

  <ul>
    <li>Nearly half of disabled students report unmet needs in education</li>
    <li>6 in 10 disabled students are bullied — one of the highest rates globally</li>
    <li>Disabled students are twice as likely to leave school with no qualifications</li>
    <li>Four times more likely to not be in education, employment, or training</li>
    <li>Yet 72% of unemployed disabled adults want to work</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These outcomes are the result of environments that often fail to affirm and empower disabled identities.</p>

  <h3>Student Voices</h3>

  <p><strong>Isla:</strong> "I used to believe I wasn’t capable of much, so I stopped dreaming big..."</p>

  <p><strong>Kahu:</strong> "I kept pushing through like everything was fine because I didn’t want to be seen as the 'difficult' one..."</p>

  <p><strong>Amelia:</strong> "Whenever I tried to talk about being disabled, people got awkward..."</p>
