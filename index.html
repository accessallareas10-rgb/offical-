  <h2>Why This Matters: A Snapshot of Urgent Need</h2>
  <img src="Picture 3.jpg" alt="student left out of circle" class="image" />
  <ul>
    <li>Nearly half of disabled students report unmet needs in education</li>
    <li>6 in 10 disabled students are bullied — one of the highest rates globally</li>
    <li>Disabled students are twice as likely to leave school with no qualifications</li>
    <li>Four times more likely to not be in education, employment, or training</li>
    <li>Yet 72% of unemployed disabled adults want to work</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These outcomes are the result of environments that often fail to affirm and empower disabled identities.</p>

  <h3>Student Voices</h3>

  <p><strong>Kahu:</strong> "I kept pushing through like everything was fine because I didn’t want to be seen as the 'difficult' one..."</p>

  <h2>Meet Sean Prenter</h2>

  <p>Kia ora I’m Sean, the founder and program lead at facilitator at Access All Areas (AAA). I started AAA because I know what it’s like to navigate education and leadership as a disabled person and how isolating and empowering that journey can be. I have a background in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (MA), I’ve been involved in the disability sector for years—both personally and professionally. I co-founded and served as Co-President of the National Disabled Students’ Association, and I’ve had the pleasure of serving on disability charities and disabled person governance boards and had the privilege of representing Aotearoa New Zealand at events like the Pacific Disability Forum, Global Disability Summit, APEC and UN events At home, I have served on the boards of Your Way | Kia Roha, the Disabled Persons Assembly National Executive Committee, and the Wellington City Council Accessibility Advisory Group, receiving the University of Otago Young Alumni Award in these efforts. I live with a traumatic brain injury, and I’ve experienced the barriers that come with being disabled: barriers in communication, access, and attitudes. I’ve also experienced the loneliness of being the only disabled person in the room. I have accessed over $30,000 in scholarships and I do not often see disabled people accessing these opportunities-I want this to change. These experiences have shaped my passion for creating spaces where disabled students feel seen, supported, and set up to thrive. To realise this transformation. My goal is simple: to give disabled students and educators the tools they need to move through life with clarity, confidence, and connection to see them thrive.</p>
