          Kia ora I’m Sean, the founder and program lead and facilitator at Access All Areas (AAA). I started AAA because I know what it’s like to navigate education and leadership as a disabled person, and how isolating and empowering that journey can be.

          I have a background in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (MA), and I’ve been involved in the disability sector for years—both personally and professionally. I co-founded and served as Co-President of the National Disabled Students’ Association, and I’ve served on disability charities and disabled person governance boards. I’ve had the privilege of representing Aotearoa New Zealand at events including the Pacific Disability Forum, Global Disability Summit, APEC, and UN events. At home, I have served on the boards of Your Way | Kia Roha, the Disabled Persons Assembly National Executive Committee, and the Wellington City Council Accessibility Advisory Group, and received the University of Otago Young Alumni Award.

        <p>
          I live with a traumatic brain injury and have experienced the barriers that come with being disabled—barriers in communication, access, and attitudes, as well as the loneliness of being the only disabled person in the room. I have accessed over $30,000 in scholarships, yet I rarely see disabled people accessing these opportunities, and I want that to change. These experiences shape my passion for creating spaces where disabled students feel seen, supported, and set up to thrive. My goal is simple: to give disabled students and educators the tools they need to move through life with clarity, confidence, and connection.
